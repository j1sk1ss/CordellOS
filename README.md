# CordellOS.MPRJ
This repository contains my attempts to build my own computer from scratch. This ReadME will contain all the information about this project, and this is where we will begin.

## Main idea 
The main idea, as you might guess, is to create my own computer (case, motherboard and OS), primarily in order to gain experience in low-level programming, engineering design, and, as an option, in design.

*Well, what to hide, I also wanted to come to the university with this work of art and try to pass at least some work on it...*

## Start of proccess
It all started with the idea of creating my own operating system to practice C and ASM skills. As a basis for my study, I chose a tutorial from nanobyte (links to all sources will be presented below) and the OsDev website.

Then, reaching the current end of the tutorial (currently 11/3/2023, video still in production), I completed the basic file system functions, integrated a simple ASM compiler with a simple shell language, and began selecting the case and board.

## Case
I decided to print the body on a 3D printer. Well, for this it was necessary to first create a model for printing.
As a reference, or basis, I chose the cases of old commodore and atari computers. Well, something like this:

*just old pc in keyboard. Don`t know what is this model*

*ATARI pc*

After modeling the model in **Blender**, I ended up with approximately the following design (Of course, I prepared for printing and left all the necessary connectors for the components):

And that`s how looks model in special app for 3D printing:

## Motherboard
The motherboard was originally planned as a board based on an 8086 processor, initially assembled from components, but after estimating the final dimensions, and the need for soldering and purchasing a huge number of components (This would have turned out to be a rather expensive undertaking), I decided to turn my attention to the Rasberry Pi 3B.

**TODO:**

- Syscalls
- ELF executing
- ะก or CPP in-build compiler
- Prepare for non-emulator device
- Print case
- Assemble
