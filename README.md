# CordellOS.MPRJ
This repo is storage of my attempts of creating own PC from scratch. In this ReadME will be situated all info about this project, and here we start.

## Main idea 
The main idea, as you might guess, is to create your own computer (case, motherboard and OS), primarily in order to gain experience in low-level programming, engineering design, and, as an option, in design.

*Well, what to hide, I also wanted to come to the university with this work of art and try to pass at least some work on it...*

## Start of proccess
It all started with the idea of creating my own operating system to practice C and ASM skills. As a basis for my study, I chose a tutorial from nanobyte (links to all sources will be presented below) and the OsDev website.

Then, reaching the current end of the tutorial (currently 11/3/2023, video still in production), I completed the basic file system functions, integrated a simple ASM compiler with a simple shell language, and began selecting the case and board.

## Case
I decided to print the body on a 3D printer. Well, for this it was necessary to first create a model for printing.
As a reference, or basis, I chose the cases of old commodore and atari computers. Well, something like this:

*just old pc in keyboard. Don`t know what is this model*

*ATARI pc*

After modeling the model in **Blender**, I ended up with approximately the following design (Of course, I prepared for printing and left all the necessary connectors for the components):

**TODO:**

- RAM detection
- CPP kernel
- Working with files (create/edit/delete) (Completed)
- USER switching
- ะก/CPP in-build compiler
